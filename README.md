# Fabric Community Mod, Maybe

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WtGipgm.png" />

This is a Fabric mod made by everyone. You, too, can join the chaos.

Rules: (subject to change)
1. No direct commits to the `src` directory, even if you have write access. Use pull requests.
2. No commenting your code. At all. You have to figure out what other people's code means!
3. Keep Pull Requests and commits as vague as possible. Again, others need to figure out your code.
4. Each person gets **ONE** pull request ***EACH WEEK*** containing their changes. This rule is somewhat flexible, provided good reason.
5. Each PR can only create **ONE** java file, be it a class, enum, interface or what have you. If you feel a single addition would be best suited to multiple files (BlockEntities for example), you may request permission to do so.
6. Each PR can, however, edit *any* existing java files, provided they do **not** change *more than half* of the existing lines, or add enough lines thus that the line count becomes *more than twice that it was prior*. This can have exceptions.
7. Each PR can only create **ONE** block texture *and* **ONE** item texture (each limited to 256x MAXIMUM).
8. Each PR can only create **ONE** of each of the other types of texture, that is guis, mobs, effects, etc. (each limited to 1024x MAXIMUM)
9. Each PR can add **ONE** sound effect (audio file shorter than 10 seconds) *and* **ONE** music track (audio file longer than 10 seconds, maximum 10 minutes)
10. Changing existing assets will be discouraged, but allowed provided good reason.
11. Any and all .json files can be added in any quantity.
12. No viruses, malware, spyware, adware, ransomware or any malicious code. Duh. This includes any code that runs outside code that could potentially meet any of these definitions. 
13. No dependencies other than Fabric API, Fabric Loader and Minecraft.
14. Attempts to circumvent these rules through means *including, but **not** limited to,* creating one massive class that does everything, creating a large number of classes within a single file, or making major changes to a class all in one line, will be moderated. (yes, this is a vague rule. it's subject to moderator's discretion)
15. Moderators reserve the right to reject or revert PRs at any time.
16. No adding stuff to Fabric API or Loader specifically for this mod. (yes, this is an actual rule ***asie***)

If any of these rules need further clarification, if you feel any of them are too strict or lenient, or if you feel more should be added, please let us know!

The rules can be modified only by moderators.
