# Fabric Community Mod, Maybe

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WtGipgm.png" />

This is a Fabric mod made by everyone. You, too, can join the chaos.

Rules: (subject to change)
- No direct commits to the `src` directory, even if you have write access. Use pull requests.
- No commenting your code. At all. You have to figure out what other people's code means!
- Keep Pull Requests and commits as vague as possible. Again, others need to figure out your code.
- Each person gets **ONE** pull request containing their changes. This rule is somewhat flexible, provided good reason.
- Each person can only create **ONE** java file, be it a class, enum, interface or what have you.
- Each person can, however, edit *any* existing java files, provided they do **not** change *more than half* of the existing lines, or add enough lines thus that the line count becomes *more than twice that it was prior*.
- Each person can only create **ONE** block texture *and* **ONE** item texture. This is in addition to the java files. Other types of textures, go wild I guess.
- Changing existing textures will be discouraged, but allowed provided good reason.
- No viruses, malware, spyware, adware, ransomware or any malicious code. Duh.
- Attempts to circumvent these rules through means such as creating one massive class that does everything, overuse of internal classes, or making major changes to a class all in one line, will be moderated. (yes, this is a vague rule. it's subject to moderator's discretion)

If any of these rules need further clarification, if you feel any of them are too strict or lenient, or if you feel more should be added, please let us know!
